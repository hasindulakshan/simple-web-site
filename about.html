            <p class="ph">Stamp collecting is a popular hobby around the world. Stamp collectors are also known as
                philatelists. <br> One can explore the history and culture of different countries through their postage
                stamps.</p>
    
            <p class="ph">Collecting stamps can be a fun and fulfilling hobby for people of all ages. Many collectors begin by
                saving stamps from letters they receive or buying inexpensive stamps  br
                from dealers or online
                marketplaces. As they learn more about stamp collecting they begin to focus on specific themes or
                countries or invest in rarer or more valuable stamps.</p>
    
            <p class="ph">Stamp collectors often use specialized tools and resources to identify and organize their collections. For
                example, stamp albums provide a way to display and store stamps, while catalogs and online databases can
                help collectors learn more about individual stamps and their value.</p>
